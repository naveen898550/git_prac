Day 2
==============================================================================
Ansible performs remote configuration of servers in
3 different ways
1 Adhoc commands
2 Playbooks
3 Roles

Ansible uses prebuild Python modules for configuring remote
servers

Important modules in Ansible
===================================
1 command: This is used to execute linux commands on the remote managed
nodes.It is the default module of Ansible

2 shell: This is used to execute shell scripts on the remote managed nodes
  it can execute command related to redirection and piping

3 user: This is used to perform user administartion on the remote servers
like creating users,assigning home dirs deleting users etc

4 file: Used for creating files/directories on the managed nodes

5 copy: This used to copy files/directories to the managed node

6 fetch: Used to copy files/directories from managed nodes to controller

7 apt: Used to for s/w package management like isntalling,deleting,upgrading
  etc.It works on Ubuntu,Debain flvours of linux

8 yum: This is similar to apt but it works on Rehat linux,Centos,Fedora etc
  flavours of Linux

9 service: Used to start stop or restart services on the managed nodes

10 uri: Used to check if a remote url is reachable or not

11 git: Used for perfroming git version controlling on the managed nodes

12 get_url: Used for downloading files from remote servers into the managed nodes

13 stat: Used to capture detailed info about files/directories on the managed nodes

14 debug: Used to display the output in JSON file format

15 include: USed to call child playbooks from a parent playbook

16 replace: Used to replace specific portions of the text in a file

17 docker_container: Used for container management on the managed nodes

18 docker_image: Used to run command related to docker images

19  docker_login: Used to login into the docker registry

20 docker_swarm: Used to setup of docker swarm architecture

====================================================================================
Adhoc command Syntax
==========================
ansible all/group_name/ipaddress -i path_of_inventory -m module_name -a 'arguments'


CommandModule
====================
Ansible command to see the memory info of all managed nodes
ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free -m'

Note: /etc/ansible/hosts is the deafult inventory file and when working on it
we need not specify the -i option
ansible all  -m command -a 'free -m'

Note: command module is the default module of Ansible and when working on it
we need not specify the -m option
ansible all   -a 'free -m'

===============================================================================
Shell Module

Ansible command to install docker on all managed nodes

ansible all -m shell -a 'curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh'

ansible all -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh' 

Ansible command to store the memory info of all managed nodes in file1
ansible all -m shell -a 'free -m > file1'
 

==============================================================================
UserModule
Ansible command to create a user and assign a password
ansible all -m user -a 'name=sai password=intelliqit' -b

Note: -b represents "become" it is used to giving higher previlages on the
       remote managed nodes

User module can also assign home dirs ,default working shell ,uid etc
ansible all -m user -a 'name=Anu password=intelliqit uid=1234  
             home=/home/ubuntu/Anu shell=/bin/bash comment="A normal user"' -b



============================================================================
file module
=================
Ansible command to create a file on all managed nodes
ansible all -m file -a 'name=/tmp/file14 state=touch'

Note: state= touch   is for creating files
state=directory is for creating directories
state=absent is for deleting file/directories

Ansible command to create a file and also change the premissions
ownership and groupship
ansible all -m file -a 'name=/home/ubuntu/file56 state=touch 
                                           owner=sai group=Anu mode=770' -b

=================================================================================
Copy Module
============
Ansible command to copy a file from controller to all managed nodes
ansible all -m copy -a 'src=file100 dest=/tmp'

Ansible command to copy a file and also change permissions ownership and group ownership
ansible all -m copy -a 'src=file100 dest=/tmp owner=root group=sai mode=764' -b

Copy module can also replace the existing content of a file
 ansible all -m copy -a 'content="Hello IntelliQ\n" dest=file1'
